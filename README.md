# issues-barriers
This repository gathers issues and barriers faced during the data collection, data harmonisation and data publication processes. These will be used to formulate a series of recommendations (based on the experience gained in project activities 1 through 3) that will be presented to and discussed with stakeholders and the broader open data community.
Both the recommendations and feedback will be duly documented in a report.
