# Issues and barriers of the GO-PEG use cases
This repository gathers issues faced and barriers encountered during the processes of data collection, data harmonisation and data publication of the GO-PEG data sets. 

Collected information will be used to formulate a series of recommendations (based on the experience gained in project activities 1 through 3) that will be presented to and discussed with the stakeholders and the broader open data community. 

Both the recommendations and feedback will be duly documented in a report.

Use the issue tracker to report problem faced with:
- data harmonisation (e.g., data models development, vocabularies, source data content, data transformation tools)
- service deployment (setup of web services / APIs for the data sharing)
- data and/or metadata publication 
- license conditions 
- data usability (to what extent can the new data sets and services be used in mainstream tools / to what extent do they meet the user needs?)


# How to report an issue:
